# FlashBackr Server

Welcome to the FlashBackr server repository! This repository contains the backend codebase for the FlashBackr social media platform.

## Introduction

FlashBackr is a dynamic social media platform built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The server side of FlashBackr is responsible for handling data storage, business logic, authentication, and communication with the client-side application.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the FlashBackr server locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd flashbackr-server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define environment variables such as database connection URI, JWT secret, etc.

4. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features

- **Express.js Backend:** FlashBackr's backend is built using Express.js, a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express.js handles routing, middleware, and HTTP requests/response handling.

- **MongoDB Database:** FlashBackr utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store user data, posts, comments, and other information. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it suitable for managing diverse data types.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** FlashBackr implements authentication mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication. It also enforces authorization rules to control access to protected resources.

- **RESTful API:** FlashBackr exposes a RESTful API that allows client applications to interact with the server, perform CRUD operations on resources, and execute business logic.

- **Middleware Functions:** FlashBackr uses middleware functions to perform tasks such as request validation
